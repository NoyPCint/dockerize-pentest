# Pentesting Dockerfile - based on [hackersploit/bugbountytoolkit]('https://hub.docker.com/r/hackersploit/bugbountytoolkit')

## Comes with tools such as following:

* Nmap
* Sqlmap
* Amass
* Sublist3r
* Subfinder
* Aquatone
* NmapAutomator
* Cool scripts I made - more coming soon


## Usage

No installation needed - just pull the latest image and run

```bash
docker run noypearl/pt-web:latest
```

### For persistance - use docker volumes when running
	
```bash
docker run -it --name pt-web -v <your_local_dir>:/root/ noypearl/pt-web:latest

```
Make sure to have docker volumes configured before running this command - otherwise the volume won't be mounted.
More on docker persistance [here]('https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/#start-a-container-with-a-volume')

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

## Coming Soon

1. create different directory in mounted volume named after docker run argument, for example 'docker run .... -v //PATH/ -s TESLA' for tesla bug bounty.

2. Add out-of-scope hosts file
